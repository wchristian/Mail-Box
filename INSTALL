INSTALL  Mail::Box

Usually, you install any perl module simply by calling

  #   perl -MCPAN -e 'install Mail::Box'

but if you want to do it manually, then execute the following.
First unpack the archive:

  #   tar xzf Mail-Box-2*.tar.gz
  #   cd  Mail-Box-2.*[0-9]

Then
  #   perl Makefile.PL
  #   make test
  #   make install
